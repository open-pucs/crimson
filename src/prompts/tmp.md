There is some documentation for how to make tracing ingest to OTEL successfully in :
/home/nicole/Documents/mycorrhizae/crimson/src/prompts/references/otel_tracing_docs.md

Could you look at these docs and figure out how to make the tracing/logging code in here successfully ingest to an otel endpoint?
