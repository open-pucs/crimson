I am getting this weird error where the s3 client is erroring out when run inside a docker container, but is running fine on my local machine when I build the binary directly?
```rs
async fn download_to_file(&self, src: &FileLocation) -> Result<LocalPath, StoreError> {
        match src {
            FileLocation::LocalPath(rel) => Ok(rel.clone()),
            FileLocation::S3Location(s3_loc) => {
                let bucket = &s3_loc.bucket;
                let key = &s3_loc.key;
                let client = make_s3_client(&self.s3_config, s3_loc).await;
                // Download object
                let resp = client
                    .get_object()
                    .bucket(bucket)
                    .key(key)
                    .send()
                    .await
                    .map_err(|err| StoreError::S3(err.into()))?;
                // Read body
                let data = resp
                    .body
                    .collect()
                    .await
                    .map_err(|_| StoreError::InvalidLocation)?;
                let bytes = data.to_vec();
                // Determine local path and write file
                let rel_path = PathBuf::from(key);
                let full_path = self.base_path.join(&rel_path);
                if let Some(parent) = full_path.parent() {
                    fs::create_dir_all(parent)
                        .await
                        .map_err(|_| StoreError::LocalFile)?;
                }
                fs::write(&full_path, &bytes)
                    .await
                    .map_err(|_| StoreError::LocalFile)?;
                Ok(full_path)
            }
        }
    }
```

Do you have any clue what could be going on here? This file is at src/logic/local_store.rs and the dockerfile is at ./Dockerfile

Keep a living diary of your thoughts at src/prompts/llm_thoughts.md as you apply stuff and figure it out.

Before you finish your task run ` RUSTFLAGS="-A warnings" cargo check --message-format=short` (Some optimisations to weed out a bunch of unneded tokens) to make sure you havent made any mistakes. Also try to avoid modifying any code that isnt absolutely essential to implement your feature.

Also you can look up documentation for popular rust libraries like tokio, serde and axum by using the context7 tool, its support on less popular libraries is limited unfortunately. Whenever you are stuck with some inscrutable errors, it can be helpful to look up examples to see how the code should be structured.
