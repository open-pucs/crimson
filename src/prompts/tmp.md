I have this function in logic/local_store.rs. Is there a way to get the client and config to use the values for s3 that I extracted out of the context in this file?

```rs
    async fn download_to_file(&self, src: &FileLocation) -> Result<LocalPath, StoreError> {
        match src {
            FileLocation::LocalPath(rel) => Ok(rel.clone()),
            FileLocation::S3Location(s3_loc) => {
                let bucket = &s3_loc.bucket;
                let key = &s3_loc.bucket;
                let region = &s3_loc.region;
                let endpoint = &s3_loc.endpoint;
                let access_key = &self.s3_config.access_key;
                let secret_key = &self.s3_config.secret_key;

                // Parse S3 URI of form s3://bucket/key
                // Load AWS config and create client
                let config = aws_config::load_defaults(BehaviorVersion::latest()).await;
                let client = Client::new(&config);
                // Download object
                let resp = client
                    .get_object()
                    .bucket(bucket)
                    .key(key)
                    .send()
                    .await
                    .map_err(|err| StoreError::S3(err.into()))?;
                // Read body
                let data = resp
                    .body
                    .collect()
                    .await
                    .map_err(|_| StoreError::InvalidLocation)?;
                let bytes = data.to_vec();
                // Determine local path and write file
                let rel_path = PathBuf::from(key);
                let full_path = self.base_path.join(&rel_path);
                if let Some(parent) = full_path.parent() {
                    fs::create_dir_all(parent)
                        .await
                        .map_err(|_| StoreError::LocalFile)?;
                }
                fs::write(&full_path, &bytes)
                    .await
                    .map_err(|_| StoreError::LocalFile)?;
                Ok(rel_path)
            }
        }
    }
```


Keep a living diary of your thoughts at prompts/llm_thoughts.md as you apply stuff and figure it out.

Before you finish your task run ` RUSTFLAGS="-A warnings" cargo check --message-format=short` (Some optimisations to weed out a bunch of unneded tokens) to make sure you havent made any mistakes. Also try to avoid modifying any code that isnt absolutely essential to implement your feature.

Also you can look up documentation for popular rust libraries like tokio, serde and axum by using the context7 tool, its support on less popular libraries is limited unfortunately. Whenever you are stuck with some inscrutable errors, it can be helpful to look up examples to see how the code should be structured.
