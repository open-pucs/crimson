For the document processing in main. I am wanting to go ahead and set up the API similarly to markers api. I threw the reference for it in prompts/references/marker_api.md. In the docs section could you go ahead and implement everything?


Make sure all the ingest and return values have their own schemas. Also if you could go ahead and throw all the doc processing functions into their own file that would be great :)


Before you finish your task run `cargo check` to make sure you havent made any mistakes.

Also you can look up documentation for axum by using the context7 tool.
