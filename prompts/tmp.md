Could you go ahead and fill out first barebone on this project. 

Namely this is a project that tries to process pdfs with very high throughput.

To start off could you make an endpoint that would just take a pdf upload through a post request, then return "Successfully ingested"

Read the exisiting file and add utoipa documentation to any new docs you add. Before you finish your task run `cargo check` to make sure you havent made any mistakes.
