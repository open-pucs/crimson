When I run this crate I get the following error.
thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:11:17:
Overlapping method route. Cannot add two method routes that both handle `POST`

Before you finish your task run `cargo check` to make sure you havent made any mistakes.

Also you can look up documentation for axum by using the context7 tool.
