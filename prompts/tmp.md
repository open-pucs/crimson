Could you go ahead and fill out the barebones on this project. 

Namely this is a project that tries to process pdfs with very high throughput.

To start off could you make an endpoint that would just take a pdf upload through a post request, then return "Successfully ingested"

It should also use something like utoipa to ensure all the endpoints are documented.
